# TimeZone-Alfred

Do you like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)? I like too… I’ve recently found bunch of very nice Workflows. For me, the most used one is for sure Time Zone.

The workflow has been created by Mr Carlos from New Zealand and published on the [Alfred Forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/491-timezones-a-world-clock-script-filter-updated-to-v17/). I’ve enhanced the workflow by adding a few new functionalities:

* Converting any time to all pre-defined time zones
* Enabling 24-hrs time format
* Displaying phone country code

After all it looks like below:
